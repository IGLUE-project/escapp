Escapp is an open-source web platform created to support teachers in designing, conducting, and managing educational escape rooms in both face-to-face and remote learning environments. It guides educators through the full workflow of running escape rooms by enabling teacher and student registration, the creation and publishing of escape rooms, and the configuration of puzzles, hints, and instructional content. The platform includes a comprehensive resource manager that supports uploading and incorporating a wide variety of file types such as images, video, audio, and PDFs, and offers a catalog of interactive components (for example, keypads and decoder disks) to enrich puzzles. In addition, Escapp offers a 2D scene editor that allows the creation of fully interactive experiences. Teachers can organise students into teams or allow individual participation, set up multiple shifts, and automate the delivery of hints and solution verification using different methods. During an activity, Escapp tracks and synchronises student progress across puzzles in real time, provides dashboards with learning analytics for monitoring engagement and performance, and supports gamification features like countdown timers, progress bars, and leaderboards to enhance motivation and competition. After an escape room session, the platform can generate and export grades and results. For educators and developers who want to extend functionality, Escapp offers both a REST API and a WebSocket interface that make it possible to integrate or build external challenges and tools alongside the core platform. The source code is publicly available under a free software licence, allowing institutions and developers to adapt and integrate Escapp within their own educational technology ecosystems.
